Thanks to prozac we have a working znc module that pushes priv messages and hilights to Colloquy Mobile.

To install make sure you have znc installed and configured, then run the following:

	$ wget http://github.com/wired/colloquypush/raw/master/znc/colloquy.cpp
	$ znc-buildmod colloquy.app
	$ mv colloquy.so ~/.znc/modules/

you should now load the "colloquy" module either by enabling it in the web admin module,
or by typing "/msg *status loadmod colloquy"

to configure your Colloquy Mobile to use Push, follow the following instructions, quoted from:
	http://colloquy.info/project/wiki/PushNotifications

1. Hit the + Button in the Connections tab and select "IRC Connection"
2. Enter the server address as the Address.
3. Select "Push Notifications" and then turn them On.
4. Go to "Advanced".
5. Enter the Server Port and toggle SSL status as necessary.
6. Enter your ZNC account name as your Username.
7. Enter your ZNC account password as the Password. (Note: not Nick Pass).
8. Go back and hit "Connect". 

Result: If all went well, you should get a message from *colloquy saying 
that push is now loaded on ZNC for your device. You can also type 
"/msg *colloquy list" to see all of the devices that receive push 
notifications from your ZNC account.

Note: badge clearing works now :)
